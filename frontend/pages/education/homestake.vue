        The major player in South Dakota gold would become the Homestake Gold Mine at Lead. First discovered in the spring of 1876, by Fred and Moses Manuel, Alex Engh and Henry Harney, the Homestake claim initially seemed no more important than other mines operating in the area. But further exploration via underground shafts revealed the claim’s true potential.
      </p>
      <p>
        In July 1876, publishing magnate George Hearst and J.B. Haggin dispatched mining engineer L.D. Kellogg to gauge the possibilities of Black Hills mineral properties. Kellogg quickly bought out the Manuels’ share of the Homestake claim for $50,000, then Harney and Engh for $45,000, and finally H.B. Young’s minority interest for $10,000.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearst quickly poured tens of thousands of dollars into developing his new mine. He shipped in an 80-stamp mill that cost $30,000 in freight charges alone. The mill went into production on Jan. 1, 1879, and  by July, it had produced $40,000 in bullion. From 1878 to 1962, the mine yielded $715 million in gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Founded in 1876, the Homestake Gold Mine would become the deepest, longest running, most productive gold mine in the western hemisphere of the world. Its shafts extended 8,000 feet underground and it would operate for 125 years, yielding some 40 million ounces of gold in its lifetime. Comparatively, the entire Black Hills produced approximately 48 million ounces of gold during the same time span, making the Homestake claim “the richest 100 square miles on earth.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Mining operations at Homestake Gold Mine ceased in 2001, due to high production costs and low commodity prices. At the time of its closure, the price of gold had plummeted to $318 per ounce. Most recently, the price of gold has hovered between $1,600 and $1,800 per ounce. Reclamation activities were primarily completed in the 2000s; however, environmental monitoring and water treatment continues. The Ross, Yates, and Ellison mining areas [CH1] are not included in this site history because these sites were donated to South Dakota Science and Technology Authority (SDSTA) in 2006.

      <strong>1.1.1.1 Sawpit Waste Rock Facility</strong><br>
      Ore was first discovered in Sawpit Gulch west of Central City, South Dakota, in 1876. The owners had set up a small stamp mill and sank two shallow shafts (less than 100 feet [ft] deep) in Sawpit Gulch. However, the efforts were not profitable, and the mine first closed in 1880. That same year, the Columbus Gold Mining Company restaked the claims and subsequently constructed a new stamp mill and 200-foot-deep Columbus Shaft. Operations were shuttered because of water shortages in 1896. In 1902, the property was purchased and mining recommenced. The Columbus Shaft was deepened to 500 ft and mining quickly idled by 1907. Homestake acquired the property in 1912; however, mining operations were never restarted [Mitchell, 2009].
      Homestake began using the Sawpit WRF for disposing barren waste rock beginning in the early 1990s through about 1997/1998. Approximately 23 million tons of rock were disposed The haul road overpass over Highway 85 was removed in 2001. The Sawpit WRF was overlain by topsoil, graded and revegetated, and a portion of the adjacent area was reclaimed for wildlife habitat. The land was released from the reclamation bond in 2006 and the area is now covered by a post-closure bond. Water is collected and treated at the Blacktail Water Treatment Plant (WTP).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>1.1.1.2 Open Cut and East Waste Rock Facility</strong><br>
      The Homestake Open Cut has two periods of mining history: 1876-1945 and 1983-1998. On April 9, 1876, the first claim was staked in the Open Cut area and the town of Terraville was developed in this area. Approximately 40 million tons of rock were mined between 1876 and 1945 (see Figure 2-3) and most of the rock was drawn from underground operations. The site of the original discovery of the Homestake deposit and the town of Terraville has long since disappeared into the Open Cut when large-scale, open pit mining renewed in 1983 and continued through 1998. Under the two large-scale mine permits, 549 acres were affected by the Open Cut [Mitchell, 2009]. Today, the Open Cut remains in a state similar to when mining of the Open Cut ceased in 1998. A 2017 technical revision was obtained to allow disposal of rock that originates from large underground excavations that are part of Fermilab’s Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF).
    </p>
    <p>
      The East WRF was the largest waste rock facility at the Homestake Mine with a capacity of approximately 104 million tons of rock. Reclamation of the East WRF was completed in 2006 with reclamation of topsoil stockpile areas and a low-grade stockpile. No indication of acid generation potential of the waste rock was found. As with the Sawpit WRF, water from the East WRF is collected and treated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Washington Street complex east of the Open Cut historically consisted of four structures, including the electrical building, substation building, and two cooling towers. A previous Phase 1 investigation of this area was conducted in 2001, and several subsequent investigations and cleanup activities have occurred since that time.

    <p><strong>1.1.1.1 Bobtail, Highland, and Yates Waste Rock Facilities</strong><br>
      The Upper Bobtail and Highland WRFs are located west of the Open Cut to the north and south of Crusher Hill, respectively.</p>

    <p>Homestake has used the Upper Bobtail WRF from 1983 to 1986. The Upper Bobtail Facility was reclaimed in 1986; however, steep slopes have required stability monitoring and seepage from the facility flows into the Open Cut. Homestake created the Lower Bobtail Facility in late 1980s, and the facility has since been incorporated into the East WRF. A total of approximately 1.9 million tons of waste rock was disposed in the Upper Bobtail WRF.</p>
    <p>The Highland WRF was built between 1985 and 1986 and approximately 1.4 million tons of waste rock was deposited in this facility. Reclamation was completed in 1986 and the area is in post-closure care.</p>
    <p>The Yates WRF is located immediately south of the Yates Shaft. The site was used between 1938 and 1987 and included waste rock from the shaft and level developments. Approximately 2.1 million cubic yards of waste rock were placed in this dump. Reclamation of the Yates WRF began in 2004 and seepage is collected and treated before being discharged to the Lead-Deadwood Sanitary District.</p>
    <p><strong>1.1.1.2 Gold Run Park/Old Mill and Sand Dam</strong>
      The lower mill (Gold Run Tract) and upper mill (Park Tract) sites were formerly home to approximately 28 mine processing buildings including the mill recycle pump room, chemical warehouse, chemical laboratory, assay office, metallurgical office, south mill thickener house and a 50-ft thickener, East Sand Plant and upper sand dam, east boiler plant, press room, and hill tanks. The historic mine processing buildings are shown in Figure 2-4. These historic structures at the mill area and the refining buildings have all been demolished and the site is currently a park. Demolition began in 2002 and reclamation continued through 2004. In addition to construction debris, impacted soils and portions of concrete foundations were also removed.</p>
    <p>The East Sand Plant (or Sand Plant No. 1) was located on Gold Run Creek. Operations started in 1901 and the demolition work began in 2002 and was completed in 2009. Park construction began in 2003 with park displays constructed in 2005. The Park Tract, which is now referred to as Gold Run Park, was created to preserve the historical significance of the Homestake Mine mill area. This park consists of an open-air museum, trail, picnic area, and parking [JBR and Maxim Technologies, 2006].</p>

    <p>The Blacktail WTP is located near Central City, South Dakota, at the site of Homestake’s former Cyanide Plant No. 2 in Blacktail Gulch (see Figure 2-5). The cyanide plant was used to process the sand fraction of the ore from three stamp mills between 1902 and 1934. The original cyanide plant was demolished in 1965 [Mitchell, 2009].</p>
    <p>The current WTP was constructed in 2006. The plant treats water emanating from the toes of the Sawpit Waste Rock and East Waste Rock facilities. The WTP removes selenium and TDS before discharging water to Deadwood Creek or the Lead-Deadwood Sanitary District’s treatment plant. Effluent to Deadwood Creek meets South Dakota surface water quality standards for cold-water marginal fish and permitted effluent limits. Regular habitat, biological, and water quality monitoring do not indicate adverse downstream impacts from the Homestake Mine [Homestake Mining Company, 2021].</p>

    <p><strong>1.1.1.1 Wasp Pit</strong><br>
      The Wasp Pit area is located west of Grizzly Gulch. The Wasp and Bismarck Mines operated as underground and surface workings from 1890 through 1917 (see Figure 2-6). Homestake purchased the property in the late 1930s with the belief there might be possible gold resource; however, Homestake did not mine or process tailings from either of these two sites. The property laid dormant, and in the 1980s and early 1990s, several efforts were made by Homestake to reclaim the tailings because the tailings were erosive and adjacent to Whitewood Creek. These early efforts failed to stabilize the tailings. In 1997, SD DENR approved a project to remove the Wasp/Bismarck tailings to Homestake’s Grizzly Gulch Tailings Impoundment. 
    </p>
    <p>The tailings removal project commenced in June 1997 and was completed during 1997 and 1998. Virtually all the tailings (approximately 240,000 yards) were removed from the hillside and floodplain of the Wasp and Bismarck Mine sites and transported to Grizzly Gulch Tailings impoundment.</p>
    <p>In 1998, SD GFP and Homestake undertook a cooperative project to reclaim the adjacent Whitewood Creek floodplain. The tailings in the floodplain area were removed and various habitat improvements were made that included a 0.5-acre pond, a wetland, and an introduction of various snags and brush piles [Scheetz, 2002].</p>

    <p><strong>1.1.1.1 Grizzly Gulch</strong><br>
    Following the enactment of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, Homestake had to develop a solution to dispose of approximately 3,000 tons of tailings per day. Tailings were previously used as mine backfill and discharged into Gold Run Creek (which flows into Whitewood Creek).</p>
    <p>The Grizzly Gulch Tailings impoundment, which is located approximately 1 mile south of Homestake’s mill site, was constructed beginning in 1976 and completed in 1977 (see Figure 2-7). Tailings from the Homestake Mine were transported along a 3-mile pipeline. The impoundment was created by the construction of a 2-million-cubic-yard earth starter dam that was 229 ft high. Three additional lifts (completed in 1983, 1989, and 1999) raised the height of the dam an additional 130 ft [Mitchell, 2009]. The maximum operating capacity of the tailings facility is 1.775 billion gallons of water at a maximum operating pond elevation of 5,463 ft. Water level in the tailings facility is surveyed and the volume is calculated monthly; normal operating level is an elevation of 5,445 to 5,455 ft mean seal level (msl). Approximately 40 million tons of tailings are currently contained within the facility. In addition to the Homestake slurry pumped tailings, approximately 240,000 tons of tailings from the adjacent Wasp and Bismarck Mines were hauled by truck to the tailings facility in 1997–1998. These tailings were deposited into a separate site in the southwestern portion of the Grizzly Gulch Facility.</p>
    <p>A 15-foot-wide interceptor canal that is 4.5 miles long was constructed around the impoundment area to intercept and discharge normal storm water runoff from the gulch slopes before these waters could enter the impoundment and become contaminated. A 20-foot-deep, 25-foot-wide seepage collection trench was also constructed across the gulch downstream of the dam. Pumps located in the seepage collection building collect and pump the seepage back to the Grizzly Gulch supernatant pond. A barge-mounted pumping station is also located in the supernatant pond to pump water to the SDSTA WTP for treatment and discharge to Gold Run Creek. An average of 400 gallons per minute (gal/min) of water from seepage, subsurface alluvial flows, and precipitation are pumped from the Grizzly Gulch pond to SDSTA for treatment. Approximately 50 acres of the Grizzly Gulch tailings facility were covered and reclaimed in 2012, with an additional 40 acres planned to be covered and reclaimed in 2024.</p>

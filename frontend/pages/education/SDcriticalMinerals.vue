      <br>
      <p>Presidential Executive Order 13953 calls for the United States (US) to become less reliant on imported critical minerals. The <u>35 critical minerals</u> identified are essential to US economic and national security, and key components in essential manufactured products.</p>

      <p>This summary identifies critical minerals in South Dakota (SD) and summarizes their potential for further geologic characterization and recovery that could have future impacts on the economy of South Dakota.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>South Dakota hosts 17 critical minerals within eight (8) counties (Table 1). </li>
        <li>These resources complement those in the region, such as deposits near Sundance, WY.</li>
        <li>Fourteen (14) minerals are primary commodities and 12 are secondary (occurring in mine tailings) that may be economically recoverable at current market prices. </li>
        <li>Critical minerals with the most occurrences are uranium, tin, and tungsten. </li>
        <li>Uranium has potential for further development near Edgemont, based on market price and demand. </li>
        <li>Beryllium, tin, tungsten, lithium, tantalum, niobium, and cesium are primarily associated with past production near Keystone and Hill City. Reprocessing tailings at some mines may be economic using modern methods. </li>
        <li>Beryllium, lithium, and antimony occurrences need updated geologic characterization to estimate current economic potential. </li>
        <li>Manganese occurrences in Custer and Lyman Counties need further geologic characterization to estimate current economic potential. </li>
        <li>Prospects for economic Rare Earth Element deposits are being explored but occurrences are not well documented. </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>The <a target="blank_" href="https://mrdata.usgs.gov/mrds/">United States Geological Surveyâ€™s Mineral Resources Data System (MRDS)</a> (McFaul, et. al, 2000) was used to search for the occurrences of critical minerals in South Dakota. South Dakota is host to 17 critical minerals (Table 1) of varying quantities within two central counties (Buffalo and Lyman) and six western counties (Perkins, Harding, Lawrence, Pennington, Custer, and Fall River).  Based on the number of MRDS records listed in parentheses, the following 17 critical minerals are listed in descending order. </p>

      <ul>
        <li><u><b>Uranium</b></u> (228) is noted mainly as a past producer with some current production and numerous occurrences and prospects.

        <li><u><b>Tantalum</b></u> (60) is noted as mainly a past producer with some current production and limited occurrences and prospects.  The three counties of Custer, Lawrence and Pennington are the host to these deposits associated with the mining of the main ore minerals amblygonite, beryl, albite and cassiterite in the rock types of pegmatite and schist.</li>
        <li><u><b>Niobium</b></u> (37) is noted as mainly a past producer with some current production and very limited occurrences and prospects.

        <li><u><b>Manganese</b></u> (16) is noted as mainly a past producer with limited occurrences.  The two counties of Buffalo and Lyman in addition to Custer and Lawrence are host to these deposits.  The counties of Buffalo and Lyman are associated with the limited mining of manganese nodules in the gravels proximal to the Missouri River.  Custer county is associated with occurrences of the main ore mineral identified as pyrolusite and Lawrence county is associated with the mining of the ore minerals gold and vanadinite in the rock type limestone.</li>

      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>The critical minerals beryllium, tin, tungsten, lithium, tantalum, niobium, and cesium are mainly associated with the past production of the pegmatite bodies located in the vicinity of the towns of Keystone and Hill City. In one example, these pegmatite bodies were mined to supply lithium during World War II for high-pressure grease used in airplane engines as well as lithium hydride to fill aerial balloons and life jackets/lifeboats.  The reprocessing of mine dumps at the Bob Ingersoll (Hanley, 1953) and Tin Mountain (Stoll, 1953) mines associated with the mining of pegmatites (Roberts and Cope, 1968) may allow for the realization of recoverable minerals based on modern processing methods as well as market price and demand. </p>
      <p>The occurrences in Custer county associated with pyrolusite may benefit from additional geologic characterization if further exploration is warranted. </p>
      <p>The critical minerals noted with numerous occurrences and prospects include uranium, tin, and tungsten with some occurrences and prospects include beryllium, lithium, and antimony may benefit from additional geologic characterization/exploration that could possibly lead to future development.  </p>
